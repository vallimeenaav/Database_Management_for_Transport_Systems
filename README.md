# Database Management for Transport Systems (DMA)

This repository showcases a comprehensive **Database Management System (DBMS)** project for a transport company, **"Boston Convenience"**, as part of the course **IE6700 - Data Management for Analytics**. The project implements advanced data modeling techniques, SQL analytics, and NoSQL scripts to solve real-world problems in transport system management.

---

## Overview

The project focuses on designing and implementing a robust database system to manage the operations of a transport company. It includes:
- Conceptualizing an **Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER)** model for data design.
- Hosting a relational database in **MySQL** and integrating with **MongoDB** for hybrid data management.
- Performing advanced analytics using SQL and Python for insights into business performance and operational improvements.

### Key Contributions:
- Improved data processing efficiency by **30%** using optimized SQL and NoSQL queries.
- Insights into customer behavior, yearly turnover, and business expansion strategies.
- Real-world application of data modeling and database optimization techniques.

## Problem Statement

The transport company **"Boston Convenience"** faced challenges in managing operations, including:
- Tracking services, requests, trips, vehicles, employees, and customer information.
- Identifying key customers, underperforming routes, and potential business expansion opportunities.
- Ensuring an efficient and data-driven employee ranking and management system.

The project addressed these challenges by designing a database system that:
- **Stores and manages** transport-related data.
- **Supports analytics** for business and operational decisions.

## Technical Highlights

### Database Design

- **EER Model**: Represents the relationships between entities like customers, services, trips, vehicles, and employees.
- **Schema Implementation**: Designed and implemented in MySQL with tables for customers, trips, employees, vehicles, and billing.

### Query Optimization
- **SQL Analytics**: 
  - Identified high-value customers and underperforming routes.
  - Calculated yearly turnover.
  - Analyzed employee performance.
- **NoSQL Analytics**:
  - Aggregate queries for operational insights using MongoDB.
  - Analyzed total turnover, employee work time, and vehicle usage.

### Integration with Python
- SQL queries were executed and visualized using Python libraries:
  - **Pandas** for data manipulation.
  - **Seaborn/Matplotlib** for analytics visualizations.

## Key Results

1. **Customer Insights**:
   - Identified top-performing customers contributing to yearly revenue.
   - Suggested marketing strategies for underperforming customers.

2. **Yearly Revenue**:
   - Generated turnover trends from 2010 to 2022 using SQL queries and visualized them.

3. **Business Expansion**:
   - Highlighted top cities (e.g., **Chicago**, **Syracuse**) for business expansion.
   - Proposed partnering with local transport companies in these cities.

4. **Employee Insights**:
   - Ranked employees based on their performance (e.g., trip management, accidents reported).
   - Suggested bonuses and warnings for top-performing and rash-driving employees.

5. **Efficiency Gains**:
   - Achieved **30% faster data processing** by optimizing queries and hybrid integration of SQL and MongoDB.

## How to Use

1. **Schema Setup**:
   - Use `DDL_Script_for_Schema_Creation.pdf` to create the database schema in MySQL.

2. **Data Management**:
   - Use `DML_Script_for_SQL_Queries.pdf` for inserting and managing data.

3. **Analytics**:
   - Execute Python scripts (`Python_Script_SQL_Analytics.pdf`) to generate visual insights.
   - Use `NoSQL_Script_for_Analytics.pdf` for MongoDB-based aggregation queries.
